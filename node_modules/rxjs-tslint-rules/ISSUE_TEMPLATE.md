<!--

Before submitting an issue, please ensure that TSLint's `no-unused-variable` rule is **not** enabled in your configuration (or in any configuration that you extend). That rule [has caused problems in the past](https://github.com/cartant/rxjs-tslint-rules/issues/4) - as it leaves the TypeScript program in an unstable state - and has a [significant number of still-open issues](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/search?q=no-unused-variable&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93). Consider using the `no-unused-declaration` rule from [`tslint-etc`](https://github.com/cartant/tslint-etc) instead.
